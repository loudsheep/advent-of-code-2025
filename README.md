# Advent of Code 2025 - Rust Solutions

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), written in Rust.

## Structure

- **Solutions**: Located in `src/bin/`. Each day is a separate binary (e.g., `day1.rs`).
- **Inputs**: Puzzle inputs are stored in the `input/` directory.

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin day<number>
```

For example, to run Day 1:

```bash
cargo run --bin day1
```
